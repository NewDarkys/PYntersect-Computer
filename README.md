# PYntersect Computer 

(Ссылка на русский перевод README [тык](https://github.com/NewDarkys/PYntersect-Computer/blob/main/readme/readme_ru.md) )

**PYntersect-Computer** is an analogue of the **xsublim** and **Intersect Computer** programs, written in Python. It provides the ability to render LaTeX formulas, supports color changes, and allows for timing configurations. Thanks to the absence of a window, sublims can render over games (as long as they are running in windowed mode).

**Supported OS**: Windows / Linux (not tested)
